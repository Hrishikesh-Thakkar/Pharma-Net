My Final Assignment in my UpGrad IIIT Blockchain Certificate.

I had to build a Blockchain Solution addressing the issue of drug counterfeiting in a pharmaceutical supply chain. The requirement involved using Hyperledger Fabric.

There were 5 Stakeholders involved:
1. Manufacturers: All the drug manufacturers that are registered or will be registered in the future with the network will belong to this level. For example, companies like ‘Sun Pharma’ and ‘Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories’ that are drug manufacturing companies will be a part of the ‘Manufacturers’ organisation.

2. Distributors: All the drug distributors that are registered or will be registered in the future on the network will belong to this organisation. These distributors will purchase drugs directly from the manufacturers. For example, companies like ‘VG pharma’ and ‘Medico Labs’ would constitute drug distributors and be a part of the ‘Distributors’ organisation.

3. Retailers: All pharmacists or drug retailers will be a part of this organisation. The retailers will receive drug consignments from the distributors. 

4. Consumers: These are the people who purchase medicines from pharmacists. 

5. Transporters: A transporter is an entity that is responsible for the shipment of consignments from one point to another. For example, entities like Blue Dart or FedEx will serve as transporters to ship the drug consignments from Manufacturers to Distributors. Similarly, if a consignment has to be shipped from a Distributor to a Retailer, a transporter will be required. 

The requirements involved:
1. Company Registration
2. Drug Registration
3. Drug Transfer
4. View Lifecycle of a Drug
